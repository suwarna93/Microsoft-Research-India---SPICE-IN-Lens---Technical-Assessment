1.  Identify any website that regularly posts publicly accessible PDF files. Examples may include some government website that posts PDFs of notices and circulars, 
    court websites that posts PDFs of judgements, arXiv or journal websites that posts PDFs of research papers.

2.   Use Selenium IDE to record a test automation to download the latest PDF posted on your chosen website. Your script must download the latest PDF posted 
     when the script is run, and not hardcode the file to download.


3.   Use selenium side runner to execute your SIDE file via the command line and verify that your automation works as expected.

4.   Export the generated .side file from the previous step and check-in to your GitHub repository under any permissive open-source license.
